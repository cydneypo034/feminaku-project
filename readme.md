## Feminaku

**Feminaku** is an upcoming social networking application for women who love all things anime. Feminaku is a combination of the word *feminine* and *otaku*, a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, particularly in anime and manga. Women who visit the application can add their personal information, as well as, add information about their favorite anime and information about what they enjoy shopping for merchandise from their favorite show. **Feminaku** has a target audience of women because the amount of social networking sites that are geared towards women who love and watch anime is very low. The plans for expansion in the future include adding more categories such as video games, manga and music.
